# The PUDL Data Catalog
A data catalog for distributing open energy system data liberated by Catalyst
Cooperative as part of our [Public Data Liberation
Project](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl) (PUDL). This catalog uses
the Intake library developed by Anaconda to provide a uniform interface to versioned
data releases published to cloud resources.
