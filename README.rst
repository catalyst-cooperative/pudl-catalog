This repository houses a data catalog distributing open energy system data
liberated by `Catalyst Cooperative <https://catalyst.coop>`__ as part of our
`Public Utility Data Liberation Project
<https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl>`__ (PUDL). It uses the `Intake
library <https://github.com/intake/intake>`__ developed by Anaconda to provide a
uniform interface to versioned data releases hosted on publicly accessible cloud
resources.

Catalog Contents
----------------

Currently available datasets

PUDL Catalog Usage
------------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can install the PUDL Catalog using conda:

.. code:: text

   conda install -c conda-forge catalystcoop.pudl

or pip:

.. code:: text

   pip install catalystcoop.pudl-catalog

Import the Intake Catalogs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``pudl_catalog`` registers itself as an available data source within Intake when
it's installed, so you can grab it from the top level Intake catalog. To see what data
sources are available within the catalog you turn it into a list (yes this is weird).

.. code:: py

   import intake
   import pandas as pd
   from pudl_catalog.helpers import year_state_filter

   pudl_cat = intake.cat.pudl_cat
   list(pudl_cat)

.. code:: text

  [
    'hourly_emissions_epacems',
    'hourly_emissions_epacems_partitioned',
    'pudl',
    'ferc1',
    'censusdp1tract'
  ]

Inspect the catalog data source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Printing the data source will show you the YAML that defines the source,
but with all the Jinja template fields interpolated and filled in:

.. code:: py

   pudl_cat.hourly_emissions_epacems

.. code:: text

   hourly_emissions_epacems:
     args:
       engine: pyarrow
       storage_options:
         simplecache:
           cache_storage: /home/zane/.cache/intake
       urlpath: simplecache::gs://intake.catalyst.coop/dev/hourly_emissions_epacems.parquet
     description: Hourly pollution emissions and plant operational data reported via
       Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) as required by 40 CFR Part 75.
       Includes CO2, NOx, and SO2, as well as the heat content of fuel consumed and gross
       power output. Hourly values reported by US EIA ORISPL code and emissions unit
       (smokestack) ID.
     driver: intake_parquet.source.ParquetSource

Data source specific metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``source.discover()`` method will show you some internal details of
the data source, including what columns are available and their data
types:

.. code:: py

   pudl_cat.hourly_emissions_epacems.discover()

.. code:: text

   {'dtype': {'plant_id_eia': 'int32',
     'unitid': 'object',
     'operating_datetime_utc': 'datetime64[ns, UTC]',
     'year': 'int32',
     'state': 'int64',
     'facility_id': 'int32',
     'unit_id_epa': 'object',
     'operating_time_hours': 'float32',
     'gross_load_mw': 'float32',
     'heat_content_mmbtu': 'float32',
     'steam_load_1000_lbs': 'float32',
     'so2_mass_lbs': 'float32',
     'so2_mass_measurement_code': 'int64',
     'nox_rate_lbs_mmbtu': 'float32',
     'nox_rate_measurement_code': 'int64',
     'nox_mass_lbs': 'float32',
     'nox_mass_measurement_code': 'int64',
     'co2_mass_tons': 'float32',
     'co2_mass_measurement_code': 'int64'},
    'shape': (None, 19),
    'npartitions': 1,
    'metadata': {'title': 'Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) Hourly Data',
     'type': 'application/parquet',
     'provider': 'US Environmental Protection Agency Air Markets Program',
     'path': 'https://ampd.epa.gov/ampd',
     'license': {'name': 'CC-BY-4.0',
      'title': 'Creative Commons Attribution 4.0',
      'path': 'https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0'},
     'catalog_dir': '/home/zane/code/catalyst/pudl-catalog/src/pudl_catalog/'}}

.. note::

    If the data has not been cached this method might take a while to finish depending
    on your internet speed. The EPA CEMS parquet data is almost 5 GB.

Read some data from the catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To read data from the source you call it with some arguments. Here we’re
supplying filters (in “disjunctive normal form”) that select only a subset of
the available years and states. This limits the set of Parquet files that need
to be scanned to find the requested data (since the files are partitioned by
``year`` and ``state``) and also ensures that you don’t get back a 100GB
dataframe that crashes your laptop. These arguments are passed through to
`dask.dataframe.read_parquet()
<https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/generated/dask.dataframe.read_parquet.html>`__
since Dask dataframes are the default container for Parquet data. Given those
arguments, you convert the source to a Dask dataframe and the use ``.compute()``
on that dataframe to actually read the data and return a pandas dataframe:

.. code:: py

   filters = year_state_filter(
       years=[2019, 2020],
       states=["ID", "CO", "TX"],
   )
   epacems_df = (
       pudl_cat.hourly_emissions_epacems(filters=filters)
       .to_dask()
       .compute()
   )
   cols = [
       plant_id_eia,
       operating_datetime_utc,
       year,
       state,
       operating_time_hours,
       gross_load_mw,
       heat_content_mmbtu,
       co2_mass_tons,
   ]
   epacems_df[cols].head()

.. csv-table::
   :header: plant_id_eia, operating_datetime_utc, year, state, operating_time_hours, gross_load_mw, heat_content_mmbtu, co2_mass_tons

Planned data distribution system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We’re in the process of implementing automated nightly builds of all of our data
products for each development branch with new commits in the main PUDL
repository. This will allow us to do exhaustive integration testing and data
validation on a daily basis. If all of the tests and data validation pass, then
a new version of the data products (SQLite databases and Parquet files) will be
produced, and placed into cloud storage.

These outputs will be made available via a data catalog on a corresponding
branch in this ``pudl-catalog`` repository. Ingeneral only the catalogs and data
resources corresponding to the ``HEAD`` of development and feature branches will
be available. Releases that are tagged on the ``main`` branch will be retained
long term.

The idea is that for any released version of PUDL, you should also be able to
install a corresponding data catalog, and know that the software and the data
are compatible. You can also install just the data catalog with minimal
dependencies, and not need to worry about the PUDL software that produced it at
all, if you simply want to access the DBs or Parquet files directly.

In development, this arrangement will mean that every morning you should have
access to a fully processed set of data products that reflect the branch of code
that you’re working on, rather than the data and code getting progressively
further out of sync as you do development, until you take the time to re-run the
full ETL locally yourself.

Benefits of Intake Catalogs
---------------------------

The Intake docs list a bunch of `potential use cases
<https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases.html>`__. Here are some
features that we’re excited to take advantage of:

Rich Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Intake catalog provides a human and machine readable container for metadata
describing the underlying data, so that you can understand what the data
contains before downloading all of it. We intend to automate the production of
the catalog using PUDL’s metadata models so it’s always up to date.

Local data caching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rather than downloading the same data repeatedly, in many cases it’s possible to
transparently cache the data locally for faster access later. This is especially
useful when you’ve got plenty of disk space and a slower network connection, or
typically only work with a small subset of a much larger dataset.

Manage data like software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Intake data catalogs can be packaged and versioned just like Python software
packages, allowing us to manage depedencies between different versions of
software and the data it operates on to ensure they are compatible. It also
allows you to have multiple versions of the same data installed locally, and to
switch between them seamlessly when you change software environments. This is
especially useful when doing a mix of development and analysis, where we need to
work with the newest data (which may not yet be fully integrated) as well as
previously released data and software that’s more stable.

A Uniform API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the data sources of a given type (parquet, SQL) would have the same
interface, reducing the number of things a user needs to remember to access the
data.

Decoupling Data Location and Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having users access the data through the catalog rather than directly means that
the underlying storage location and file formats can change over time as needed
without requiring the user to change how they are accessing the data.
